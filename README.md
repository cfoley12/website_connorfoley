Reach Features

CSS
	In addition to having a background and a styled navigation bar, we have added a few polishes that we think make our site more enjoyable for the user
		1. On the About Us page, our pictures expand when a user hovers over them and if you click on a picture you are taken to our linkedin pages
		2. On the results page (reached after navigating through courses and races) the results scroll seperate from the navigation bar so it is always easy to access

Calculator
	Our calculator feature allows a user to enter his time on a specific course and recieve an output for our predicted times on each course we analyzed.
	We accomplished this by taking input through an html <form> and then doing analysis with a javascript code (see templates/calculator.html for the specific code). We then print the result of the javascript code.


We hope you enjoy!

    <h2>What are Speed Ratings?</h2>
    <p>We were inspired by a New York-based website (<a href="http://tullyrunners.com" target="_blank">tullyrunners.com</a>) that allows high school runners in New York to compare thier times with competitors across different courses. Using race results from <a href="http://www.athletic.net" target="_blank">athletic.net</a>, we have tried to conduct a similar analysis of ten courses in Michigan. All of our selected courses held more than 5 indiviudal races in the Fall 2015 cross country season. Using a program we wrote, we have attempted to standardize race performances by accounting for course difficulty. We hope you enjoy it!

    <h2>The courses with the speed ratings are:</h2>
    {% for course in courses %}
    	<a href="/races/{{ course }}">{{ course }}</a> <br>
    {% endfor %}
